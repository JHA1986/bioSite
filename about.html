<!-- Short Bio. Paragraphs describing Holly's background, interests, and family -->
            <p>     Holly was born on October 30, 2016. It was an extra special day as it happened to also be her mom’s birthday as well.  
                Over the last 8 1/2 years, I’ve watched Holly grow into the wonderful young girl that she is today.  
                Since day one she has been full of energy, curiosity, and great observation. 
                She has developed many interests over the years that include singing and dancing, geography and world cultures, as well as animals and insects.</p>
            <p>     She’s tried and participated in a few activities like dance class, art class, volleyball, karate, and swimming.  
                She’s developed a love for anime and eastern cultures that was introduced to her by her mom and aunt.  
                She actually went to her first Japanese restaurant for her 7th birthday and enjoyed her favorite sushi!</p>
            <p>     Holly is currently in 3rd grade and has had a great experience each year with her class and teachers.  
                She has been able to participate in many school activities, such as fundraisers, Watchdog, holiday parades, field days, along with many field trips.  
                She has always enjoyed school and has a lot to share with her parents each day.</p>
            <p>     Holly is a big sister to her sister Mackenzie. Mackenzie was born when Holly was 4 so she has always watched out for her sister and has been a very big help in taking care of her with mom and dad.  
                As Mackenzie has become older, they are able to play more together and she has continued to keep Mackenzie safe and help her parents keep an eye on the youngest sibling.  
                Although they may scream at each other, Holly always makes sure Mackenzie is safe.</p>
            <p>     Holly is full of many interesting topics and hobbies to discuss and is very excited to be a part of this project.</p>
